## The Build

A relay is a device that can control circuits with large loads and voltage with logic-level voltages. This allows a microcontroller like Arduino to control powerful circuits that would otherwise fry the Arduino. The idea of gain is important here as a relay allows a relatively small voltage to control an arbitrarily large circuit. Think of a relay as an logic controllable switch.
